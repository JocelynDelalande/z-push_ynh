Installing and updating from GIT can be time consuming, because we will have conflicts
with the config.php files.
Until upstream finds a good solution we can use this trick:


Setup

    Clone the repository to your web server
    git checkout -b config to create the new config branch with the local configuration

Updating

    Backup the local repository (or even better: also do this on a non-live copy)
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master to update the local master branch
    git checkout config
    git rebase master to rebase the offline config branch
    Solve the conflicts (which will occur if the configuration files have been changed in the master)
